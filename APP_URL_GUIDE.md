# üåê Meridian App - Find Your Deployment URL

## Quick Answer
Based on your successful Cloudflare Pages deployment, your app URL is most likely:

**`https://meridian-real-estate.pages.dev`**

## How to Find Your Exact URL

### Method 1: Cloudflare Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. Click "Pages" in the left sidebar
3. Find your "meridian-real-estate" project
4. The URL will be displayed prominently on the project overview page

### Method 2: Wrangler CLI
If you have the Wrangler CLI installed:
```bash
# List your pages projects
wrangler pages project list

# Get project details
wrangler pages project get meridian-real-estate
```

### Method 3: Check Your Email
Cloudflare typically sends deployment confirmation emails with the URL.

## Possible URL Formats

Based on your configuration, your app could be accessible at:

1. **Default Pages URL:**
   - `https://meridian-real-estate.pages.dev`
   - `https://main.meridian-real-estate.pages.dev`

2. **Custom Domain (if configured):**
   - `https://meridian-rd.com`
   - `https://www.meridian-rd.com`

3. **Branch-specific URLs:**
   - `https://[branch-name].meridian-real-estate.pages.dev`

## Understanding Your Deployment

From your build logs, I can see:
- ‚úÖ Build completed successfully
- ‚úÖ 141 files uploaded to Cloudflare Pages
- ‚úÖ Deployment successful
- ‚úÖ Project name: "meridian-real-estate"

## Next Steps

1. **Access Cloudflare Dashboard** to get the exact URL
2. **Test the URL** to ensure the app is working correctly
3. **Set up custom domain** if you want to use meridian-rd.com
4. **Update environment variables** with the correct URL

## Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

If you want to use `meridian-rd.com`:

1. In Cloudflare Pages dashboard:
   - Go to your project
   - Click "Custom domains"
   - Add "meridian-rd.com"
   - Follow DNS configuration instructions

2. Update your environment variables:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://meridian-rd.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://meridian-rd.com/api
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you can't find your URL:
- Check your Cloudflare account email for deployment notifications
- Verify you're logged into the correct Cloudflare account
- Check if the deployment is in a different environment (staging vs production)

## Security Note

Your deployment is live and accessible to the public. Make sure:
- All environment variables are properly configured
- No sensitive information is exposed
- SSL is enabled (Cloudflare Pages includes this by default)
